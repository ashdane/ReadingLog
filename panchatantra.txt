The Monkey and the Crocodile
--title--
Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a mango tree beside a river. A crocodile who lived in the river became friends with the monkey. The monkey gave the crocodile delicious mangoes every day.
One day, the crocodile took some mangoes home to his wife. The wife grew jealous and plotted to eat the monkey’s heart, thinking it must be so sweet. She convinced the crocodile to invite the monkey home.
While carrying the monkey across the river, the crocodile revealed his wife’s plan. The smart monkey said, “Oh no! I left my heart on the tree. Let’s go back and get it.”
The crocodile turned around, and as soon as they reached the tree, the monkey leapt to safety.

The Foolish Lion and the Clever Rabbit
--title--
In a jungle lived a ferocious lion who killed many animals every day. Tired of the killings, the animals made a deal with him: they would send one animal a day as his food. The lion agreed.
One day it was the rabbit’s turn. He deliberately arrived late. The angry lion roared, and the rabbit calmly said, “I was stopped by another lion claiming to be the real king.”
The lion demanded to be taken to this rival. The rabbit led him to a well and pointed inside. Seeing his reflection, the lion thought it was the other lion and jumped in to attack. He drowned.
Moral: Wisdom can win over brute strength.

The Tortoise and the Geese
--title--
A tortoise lived near a pond with two geese. When the pond dried up, the geese offered to fly the tortoise to another place, using a stick held between their beaks while the tortoise held it with his mouth.
They warned him not to speak. As they flew, people below were amazed. Hearing their chatter, the tortoise felt proud and opened his mouth to speak—only to fall and die.
Moral: Speak only when necessary; pride and talkativeness can be dangerous.
