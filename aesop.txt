The Wolf And The Lamb 
WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay 
violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the 
Wolf’s right to eat him. He thus addressed him: “Sirrah, last year you 
grossly insulted me.” “Indeed,” bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone 
of voice, “I was not then born.” Then said the Wolf, “You feed in my 
pasture.” “No, good sir,” replied the Lamb, “I have not yet tasted 
grass.” Again said the Wolf, “You drink of my well.” “No,” exclaimed the 
Lamb, “I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother’s milk is both food 
and drink to me.” Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying, 
“Well! I won’t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my 
imputations.” The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

The Bat And The Weasels 
A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be 
spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the 
enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a 
mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to 
the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated 
not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to 
mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a 
second time escaped. 
It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.

The Ass And The Grasshopper 
AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted; 
and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort 
of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied, 
“The dew.” The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a 
short time died of hunger.

The Lion And The Mouse 
A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising 
up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse 
piteously entreated, saying: “If you would only spare my life, I would 
be sure to repay your kindness.” The Lion laughed and let him go. It 
happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, 
who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing 
his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, 
exclaiming: 
“You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting 
to receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is 
possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.”

The Charcoal-Burner And The Fuller 
A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met 
a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying 
that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping 
expenses would be lessened. The Fuller replied, “The arrangement is 
impossible as far as I am concerned, for whatever I should whiten, you 
would immediately blacken again with your charcoal.” 
Like will draw like.
